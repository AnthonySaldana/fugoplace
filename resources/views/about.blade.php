	<!--Our mission is to bring you the food facts behind every school and offer the food-service providers of these participating districts free Fugo-Management/Organizational tools in order to assist the staff in achieving maximum efficiency in the kitchen while providing the public with well documented nutrition information behind all meals served. We aim to inspire food-service staff with healthy, yet, tasty meals with FugoPlace exclusive recipe videos like the ones right below the Meal Planner on our Home page. We champion students! We recognize the power that a healthy/creative mind has over the future, and we wish to fan that flame by doing what we can to support the progress of a health-conscientious world.-->

Please make note that every recipe video is personally made by culinary students which are then sent to Fugo Studio for editing and citation before uploading to FugoPlace. We champion students in many of your local communities because we recognize the power that a healthy/creative mind has over the future, and we wish to fan that flame by doing what we can to support the progress of a health-conscientious world.</p>
